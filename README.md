This project, is an Android application used to track weather data reported by weather stations. This application is the mobile part
of a distirbuted application including embedded devices, a Web server and clients (browser or mobile applications).

Stations are supposed to periodically report data (internal/external temperature, pressure, humidity, luminosity, wind direction/speed) to a remote server that stores and makes data available online.
The list of stations, as well as last and last-day data for a particular station, are requested by the application to the server that returns
them as JSON arrays.

The application allow (for the moment):
- to retrieve the list of known stations, and to mark one as favorite
- to display last data reported by a given station (favorite or picked from the list)


A wiki page will further describe this project in details.

Feel free to contact me for any question.
